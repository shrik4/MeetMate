Here’s a ready-to-use **frontend UI prompt** for MeetMate AI (with **meeting link input instead of audio upload**).
Just **copy–paste this into your AI code assistant** (v0, Cursor, Replit Agent, etc.) to generate the UI.

### 🧾 FRONTEND UI PROMPT (MeetMate AI – Link-Based)

You are an expert frontend engineer and UI/UX designer.
Build a **single-page SaaS-style web app UI** for a product called:

> **MeetMate AI — Real-Time Meeting Intelligence & Auto-Decision Assistant**

---

#### 🛠 Tech & Structure

* Use **React** with **Tailwind CSS** (or clean CSS modules if Tailwind is not available).
* Create a **single-page app** layout (no complex routing required).
* The design must be:

  * Modern, clean SaaS look
  * Responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)
  * Suitable as a **hackathon demo** (fast, impressive, polished)
* Use **dummy/static data** for now where backend results will appear (no real API calls needed).

---

#### 🌗 Theme & Overall Layout

* Default to a **dark theme** with an optional **light/dark mode toggle** in the top-right.
* Main layout:

  * **Top navbar**
  * **Hero section** (short pitch)
  * **Main app panel / dashboard** for link input + results
  * **Small footer** with hackathon credits

Use lots of cards, shadows, rounded corners, and clear spacing like a modern AI SaaS dashboard.

---

#### 🔝 Navbar

Create a sticky **top navbar** with:

* Left: Logo mark + text:

  * Logo: simple circle with “MM” inside or a minimal icon
  * Text: **MeetMate AI**
* Right:

  * Links: “Product”, “How it works”, “Demo”
  * A button: **“Try Live Demo”**
  * A **theme toggle** (🌞 / 🌙 icon)

Navbar should have a subtle blur or shadow.

---

#### ⚡ Hero Section (Above the App)

Just under the navbar, show a hero section:

* Left side:

  * Big title:

    > “Turn any meeting link into instant tasks, decisions & follow-ups.”
  * Short subtitle:

    > “Paste your Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, or YouTube meeting link and let MeetMate AI convert it into summaries, action items, decisions, and a ready-to-send follow-up email.”
  * 2–3 pill-style badges:

    * “AI Meeting Intelligence”
    * “Built for Hackathons & Startups”
    * “No manual note-taking”
* Right side:

  * Simple **mock preview card** of the dashboard (a fake small screenshot-style card showing summary, tasks, etc.)

Add a primary CTA button: **“Paste a meeting link below”** that scrolls to the main app section.

---

#### 🧩 Main App / Dashboard Section

Place this below the hero, centered with max-width (e.g., `max-w-6xl mx-auto`).

Layout: **Two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile**.

---

##### 👉 Left Panel – Input & Controls

Card titled **“1. Paste your meeting link”** with:

* Label: **“Meeting recording link”**
* Input: full-width text input field with placeholder like:

  > `https://meet.google.com/...` or `https://zoom.us/j/...` or `YouTube link…`
* Below input, add:

  * A dropdown/select: **“Meeting type”**

    * Options: “Team Standup”, “Client Call”, “Project Review”, “Classroom Session”, “Brainstorming”
  * A dropdown/select: **“Language”**

    * Options: “English”, “Hindi”, “Kannada”, “Other”
* A toggle or checkbox:

  * “This is a short sample meeting (for demo)”
* Primary button: **“Analyze Meeting”**

  * Show loading state style (e.g., “Analyzing…”)
* Secondary ghost button: **“Use sample meeting link”**

  * This will be used in demo – no real logic needed, just UI.

Below buttons, add a tiny info text:

> “Note: In this hackathon version, analysis is simulated with sample AI output. Backend can be connected later to process real meeting recordings.”

---

##### 👉 Right Panel – AI Results Dashboard

Wrap all results in a card titled **“2. AI Meeting Intelligence Report”**.

Inside, use **tabs or sections** for the different outputs. Either:

* Horizontal tabs, or
* Stacked cards with headings

Include these sections:

---

###### 1. Summary Card

* Title: **“Meeting Summary”**
* Show:

  * 3–5 bullet points of dummy summary text.
* Add pill tags above or below:

  * “Duration: 30 min”
  * “Participants: 4”
  * “Mood: Mostly Positive”

---

###### 2. Decisions Card

* Title: **“Decisions Taken”**
* Show a numbered list (dummy text), like:

  1. Launch landing page on Monday.
  2. Demo video to be recorded by tomorrow.
* Optional subtle badge: “Auto-detected by AI”.

---

###### 3. Action Items Table

* Title: **“Action Items”**
* Table columns:

  * Task
  * Owner
  * Deadline
  * Priority (with colored badges: Low / Medium / High)
* Fill with 3–5 sample rows (static data).
* Add a small button on top-right: **“Copy as checklist”** (no functionality needed, just visual).

---

###### 4. Problems / Blockers

* Title: **“Problems & Blockers”**
* Show a bullet list of 2–3 issues discussed in the meeting (dummy text).
* Optional icon “⚠️” in the card header.

---

###### 5. Sentiment Timeline / Heatmap

* Title: **“Sentiment Over Time”**
* Create a simple **placeholder chart**:

  * Use any basic line chart or fake graph (static SVG or simple div-based bars is fine).
  * Show labels like: “Start”, “Middle”, “End”.
* Under the chart, add mini labels:

  * “Green = Positive”, “Red = Negative”, “Yellow = Neutral”.
* Add a short one-line insight text, e.g.:

  > “Discussion became slightly tense during deadline negotiation, then returned to neutral.”

(If chart library is too heavy, create a simple hand-crafted visualization with divs, not real data.)

---

###### 6. Auto Email Draft

* Title: **“Follow-up Email Draft”**

* Multi-line read-only textarea or styled box with a sample email like:

  > Hi team,
  > Here are the key points from today’s meeting:
  > • Landing page UI to be completed by Monday (Rahul)
  > • API integration by Monday (Shrikar)
  > • Demo video to be recorded by tomorrow
  >
  > Thanks,
  > MeetMate AI

* Add buttons:

  * **“Copy email”**
  * **“Open in mail app”** (no need to implement, just UI)

---

#### 💡 “How It Works” Mini Section

Below the dashboard, add a **3-step horizontal or vertical timeline**:

1. **Paste meeting link**
   Short text: “Provide your Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, or YouTube recording link.”

2. **AI analyzes the conversation**
   Short text: “Transcription + summarization + decision & task extraction + sentiment.”

3. **Get instant report & email**
   Short text: “Share with your team in one click. No manual note-taking.”

Each step with an icon and a card-like appearance.

---

#### 👣 Footer

A small footer at the bottom:

* Text like:

  > “Built in 20 hours for [Hackathon Name] by [Your Name]. Powered by AI.”
* Optional small links: “GitHub”, “LinkedIn”, “Privacy (Mock)”

---

#### 🎨 Styling Details

* Use **rounded-xl** or similar for cards.
* Use soft shadows, hover states and smooth transitions.
* Use **accent color** (e.g., blue or purple) for primary buttons and highlights.
* Use clear typography: large headings for sections, smaller for card titles.
* Ensure **mobile-friendly**:

  * Stack columns vertically
  * Cards full-width
  * Navbar collapses into a simple menu icon (even if non-functional).

---

#### 🧪 Dummy Data & State

* For the button **“Analyze Meeting”**, simulate a “loading state” in UI:

  * Disable button + show spinner icon + text “Analyzing…”
  * After a few seconds (using simple state), show the dashboard cards (or they can be visible by default, filled with placeholder data).
* You do **not** need real backend integration — just design the UI in a way that backend can easily hook into later.

---

#### 🧾 Deliverable

Return **complete React code** (components, Tailwind setup usage in classes) for this single-page MeetMate AI app UI, ready to run.
Focus on **clean structure, readable components, and visually impressive hackathon-ready UI**.

---

You can now just paste this into your AI code tool and let it generate the frontend.
If you want, next we can write the **backend prompt** for the link → analysis API.
