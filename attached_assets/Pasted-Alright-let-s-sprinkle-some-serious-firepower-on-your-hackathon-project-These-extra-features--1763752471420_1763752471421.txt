Alright, let’s sprinkle some *serious firepower* on your hackathon project.
These **extra features** will make MeetMate AI look like a fully-funded startup instead of a 20-hour build.
I’ll list features that are:

✅ Easy to build
🔥 High-impact for judges
🌟 Make you stand out

---

# ⭐ **HIGH-IMPACT EXTRA FEATURES FOR MEETMATE AI**

---

# 🟦 1. **Speaker Identification (Static Version)**

Even without real diarization, you can add a feature:

* Ask user: “Who spoke in this meeting?”
* Input fields: “Speaker 1 name”, “Speaker 2 name”
* Then show transcript tagged like:

```
[Ram]: We should finish UI by tomorrow.
[Priya]: I will handle testing.
```

🔥 FEELS SUPER-SMART, but no backend complexity.

---

# 🟪 2. **Timeline Highlights (Key Moments)**

AI highlights the most important timestamps:

* “Decision made at 02:14”
* “Conflict heated at 06:07”
* “Task assigned at 03:55”

You can fake timestamps → judges get impressed by the “timeline” concept.

---

# 🟩 3. **AI “Smart Insights” Section**

Create a card called **Insight Engine** with statements like:

* “This meeting had high productivity.”
* “Most action items were assigned to Rahul.”
* “Main risk: API deadline may slip.”
* “Team confidence: Medium”

🔥 Looks advanced, but you can fill it with logic on dummy data.

---

# 🟧 4. **Downloadable PDF Meeting Report**

One button: **Export Report** → Downloads a PDF containing:

* Summary
* Decisions
* Tasks
* Sentiment
* Email

You can generate a simple PDF using jsPDF.

🔥 Judges LOVE export/report features.

---

# 🟫 5. **Team Collaboration Mode (Fake but WOW)**

Add a section:

> “Share meeting report with team members: Enter emails”

You don’t need to send anything — just simulate success toast.
For hackathons, *fake-but-polished* is fine.

---

# 🔵 6. **Meeting Tags / Labels**

Auto add tags like:

* “Deadlines”
* “Planning”
* “Roadmap”
* “Client Issue”
* “Bug Discussion”

Looks like smart NLP.

---

# 🔴 7. **Emoji-Based Sentiment Bars**

Next to each summary point, show an emoji:

* 😃 positive
* 😐 neutral
* 😡 conflict
* 🤝 agreement

Small feature → *BIG visual effect*.

---

# 🟠 8. **Task Priority Auto-Classified**

Add “priority detection”:

* High
* Medium
* Low

Add colors + icons → looks professional.

---

# 🟤 9. **Meeting Efficiency Score**

Calculate a score (0–100) based on:

* # of tasks
* deadlines
* sentiment
* decisions count

You can create your own formula.

🔥 Judges LOVE “scores”.

---

# 🔷 10. **Meeting Action Timeline UI**

Create a horizontal timeline component:

```
0:00   2:15   4:30   7:10
Intro → Discussion → Decisions → Wrap-up
```

Fill with static values.

---

# 🎤 BONUS: **AI Voice Summary (Text → Speech)**

Generate a button:

**“Play 30-second audio summary”**

You can use a simple TTS API.
This is a huge WOW factor.

---

# ⚡ 11. **Chrome Extension Button (UI Only)**

Add a button:

> “Add to Chrome — Capture Google Meet”

No need to actually build extension — just show UI.
Judges think in future plans → this wins points.

---

# 🧠 12. **Future Roadmap Section**

Add a clickable menu item: “Future Roadmap” with:

* Real-time meeting analysis
* Auto-invite participants
* Calendar sync
* Slack/Teams integration
* Multi-language support
* Emotion detection

🔥 Shows vision → judges love this in hackathons.
